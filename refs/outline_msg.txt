Hi Lionel,

please let me outline what is known doable about private location proof.
"Location matching--a node at x,y,z can claim a coin at x,y,z, blinded" at
Trello.

This matching could be proved by node as "distance is below a threshold".
Let's refine the usecase as follows:
node claims a coin by creating a (non-interactive?) zero-knowledge proof
that
distance between node with coordinates (x_n, y_n, z_n)
and given location (x_l, y_l, z_l) is at most d,
with Pithagorean theorem and some reasonable thershold distance, say 10
meters.
Commitment to node coordinates is the input to verifier, together with
given coordinates;
prover private input is node location.

Unlike U-Prove or CL-based credentials,
data to be proved is integers,
not finite field or ring elements (no modulo something).
Proofs about integers are possible in Idemix setup, group of a hidden order,
introduced by Camenisch-Stadler.

Efficient "more than" proof, introduced by Lipmaa,
would include four-squares representation
for threshold-distance difference:
d^2 - ((x_n - x_l)^2 + (y_n - y_l)^2 + (z_n - z_l)^2) = a_1^2 + a_2^2 +
a_3^2 + a^4
Lagrange theorem states existence of this representation for any
non-negative integer.
This is latex notation that looks better in pdf.

A similar proof was presented at IEEE SMSDP 2010, attached.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange%27s_four-square_theorem
http://pollack.uga.edu/finding4squares.pdf

Further development would include an accumulator in place of individual
commitments
to locations at different times.
Plating would enforce "just one single location at a time, committed or
accumulated" somehow.

A group of a hidden order might be implemented in libsnark some day;
Idemix is suitable as-is to implement this proof.

With best regards,
Vadym
